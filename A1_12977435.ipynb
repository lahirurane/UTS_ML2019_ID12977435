        "In this paper, the author introduces a new machine learning algorithm called support vector network. In Support Vector Network, it handles the non-linear input vectors into high dimensional feature space and using unique properties, a linear surface is constructed in order to generalise the data to make decisions. Support-vector network is designed for two-group classification problems. The previous implementation of support vector network was implemented with a limitation where only with linearly separable data can be used. In this article, the author provides a solution to use support vector networks with non-linear data and convert the data where high generalisation abilities are delivered. Therefore, making high accuracy predictions for classification problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "The author first describes the existing approaches for pattern recognition such as neural networks and back-propagation algorithm for neural networks and that support vector networks in as powerful as neural networks. Next, the author describes the two issues that are faced. These two main issues are considered as one conceptual issue and the other as a technical issue. The conceptual issue is in identifying the correct hyperplane to generalised the data set. The author identifies the appropriate solutions in getting the margin for two classes calculating the maximal margin between the two classes. The technical issue is regarding the computational power for a higher number of dimensional spaces. A comparison between two vector space before making a non-linear conversion has been identified as a solution for the issue rather than creating the non-linear conversion at the beginning. Moreover, the author suggests allowing errors in the training set in order to allow optimal separation.\n",
        "\n",
        "As for the evaluation of the suggested method, the author has used two sets of datasets, one is a small dataset with 7000 datasets and a larger dataset with 60,000 datasets. Then the dataset was compared with human performance, decision trees, and neural networks.\n",

        "The article was written in 1996, which can consider the era of the beginning of machine learning. Although, the author describes previous mathematical models and functions that are introduced, such as pattern recognition and neural networks. The author mentions that a support vector network method was implemented previously but with a limitation. That is, the support vector network can only use by the linearly separable data set. Therefore, the author introduces the new methodology where the model can use non-linear data set. The input data is mapped to a high dimensional space with the non-linear data and then converted to a linear surface to make the decisions. In achieving this, the author suggests using the dot product formula.\n",
        "Moreover, the author integrates a formula to calculate the maximal margin between two classes. In calculating the margin, the author suggests to train the dataset chunk by chunk and select the dataset that can be separated. As a result, the error data is tolerated by the model. Finally, the author suggests an algorithm to soften the margin making the number of errors to a minimum. With these introductions, it can be considered that this research work introduced a unique method for pattern recognition integrating with algorithms that have been proposed as well.\n",
        "Furthermore, the author suggests that there can be various functions added according to the dataset to soften the margin. The author provides a Radial basis function implementation as an example as well. The author compares the results with two decision trees and with two neural networks. Overall, the research paper can be considered as a novel approach."
